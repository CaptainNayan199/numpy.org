### 引言

本行为守则适用于 NumPy 项目管理的所有网络空间，包括所有公共和私人的邮件列表、问题追踪器、 维基、 博客、 推特以及本社区使用的任何其他交流频道。 NumPy 项目不组织面对面活动。 然而，与本社区有关的活动应有一个与本社区内涵上类似的行为守则。

本行为守则应由每个正式或非正式参加本社区的、与项目有关的、与项目的活动有关的、特别是在代表项目时的人来遵守。

该守则不详尽，也不完整。 它有助于提升我们对协作、共享环境和目标的共识。 请尽量从内涵上遵循这一守则，以创造一个友好、高效益的环境来丰富有关的社区。

### 具体准则

要努力去：

1. 敞开心扉。 我们邀请任何人参加本社区。 我们更喜欢公开交流与项目有关的信息，除非讨论某些敏感问题时。 这也适用于帮助或项目支持的信息； 向公众寻求支持帮助不仅更有可能得到对某个问题的答复， 它还能确保更容易发现和纠正任何无意中的错误。
2. 充满热情、欢迎、友善和耐心。 我们怀着美好的意愿共同努力解决冲突。 我们都可能时不时遭受某种挫折，但我们不允许把沮丧变成个人攻击的工具。 一个让人感到不舒服或受到威胁的社区并不是一个富有成效的社区。
3. 保持合作。 我们的工作成果将被其他人使用，反过来，我们依靠其他人的工作来进行改进。 当我们在项目中添加一些有用的功能时，我们愿意向其他人解释它是如何运作的。 这样他们就能够在这些功能的基础上进一步改善工作效率。 我们作出的任何决定都将影响到用户和开发者，因此在作出决定时必须认真考虑后果。
4. 勤于向人请教。 没人知道所有事！ 提早提问可以避免很多麻烦的发生，所以我们鼓励提问，尽管我们可能把它们引向更合适的论坛中。 我们将努力做出反应并提供帮助。
5. Be careful in the words that we choose. We are careful and respectful in our communication, and we take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. We will not accept harassment or other exclusionary behaviour, such as:
    * Violent threats or language directed against another person.
    * Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
    * Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
    * Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history, without the sender’s consent.
    * Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
    * Unwelcome sexual attention.
    * Excessive profanity. Please avoid swearwords; people differ greatly in their sensitivity to swearing.
    * Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

### Diversity Statement

The NumPy project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone enjoys being part of. Although we may not always be able to accommodate each individual’s preferences, we try our best to treat everyone kindly.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability, to the extent that these do not conflict with this code of conduct.

Though we welcome people fluent in all languages, NumPy development is conducted in English.

Standards for behaviour in the NumPy community are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. Participants in our community should uphold these standards in all their interactions and help others to do so as well (see next section).

### Reporting Guidelines

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We also recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this Code of Conduct. Please keep this in mind when deciding on how to respond to a breach of this Code.

For clearly intentional breaches, report those to the Code of Conduct Committee (see below). For possibly unintentional breaches, you may reply to the person and point out this code of conduct (either in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate). If you would prefer not to do that, please feel free to report to the Code of Conduct Committee directly, or ask the Committee for advice, in confidence.

You can report issues to the NumPy Code of Conduct Committee at numpy-conduct@googlegroups.com.

Currently, the Committee consists of:

* Stefan van der Walt
* Melissa Weber Mendonça
* Anirudh Subramanian

If your report involves any members of the Committee, or if they feel they have a conflict of interest in handling it, then they will recuse themselves from considering your report. Alternatively, if for any reason you feel uncomfortable making a report to the Committee, then you can also contact senior NumFOCUS staff at [conduct@numfocus.org](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#persons-responsible).

### Incident reporting resolution & Code of Conduct enforcement

_This section summarizes the most important points, more details can be found in_ [NumPy Code of Conduct - How to follow up on a report](/report-handling-manual).

We will investigate and respond to all complaints. The NumPy Code of Conduct Committee and the NumPy Steering Committee (if involved) will protect the identity of the reporter, and treat the content of complaints as confidential (unless the reporter agrees otherwise).

In case of severe and obvious breaches, e.g. personal threat or violent, sexist or racist language, we will immediately disconnect the originator from NumPy communication channels; please see the manual for details.

In cases not involving clear severe and obvious breaches of this Code of Conduct the process for acting on any received Code of Conduct violation report will be:

1. acknowledge report is received,
2. reasonable discussion/feedback,
3. mediation (if feedback didn’t help, and only if both reporter and reportee agree to this),
4. enforcement via transparent decision (see [Resolutions](/report-handling-manual#resolutions)) by the Code of Conduct Committee.

The Committee will respond to any report as soon as possible, and at most within 72 hours.
