title: Numpy行为准则应知应会

---

这是NumPy行为准则委员会的指导手册。 它保证我们对问题做出一致且公正的回应。

[行为守则](/code-of-conduct) 的执行影响到我们的社区现在和未来。 我们很重视它。 在审查执行措施时，行为准则委员会将牢记以下价值观和准则：

* 人性化方式运作而非不近人情。 委员会会让各方了解情况，同时尊重举报者的隐私和任何必要的保密性。 然而，仍然存在着这种情况。 有时有必要与一个或多个人直接沟通：委员会的目标是改善我们社区的健康状况，而不仅仅是作出正式决定。
* 强调对个人遭遇的同情，而不是一味批评行为，避免出现“好”和“坏/邪恶”的二元对立标签。 我们将坚定地处理公开、明显的挑衅和骚扰问题。 但许多可能被证明具有挑战性的情形是有些正常的分歧会转化为多方无助或有害的行为。 了解整个背景并找到一条使所有人都能重新参与进来的道路是困难的，但最终对我们社区最有成效。
* 我们都知道，电子邮件是一个孤立的、沟通困难的媒介。 在没有个人联系方式的情况下收到匿名举报邮件，可能特别令人痛苦。 这使得保持一种尊重他人意见的开放气氛变得特别重要。 这还意味着我们的所有行为必须公开透明。 我们将竭尽全力确保我们所有成员得到公平和同情的待遇。
* 歧视可能是微妙且不负责任的。 它在一定程度上表现出不公平和敌意的态度，而不是正常的互动。 我们知道这种情况确实发生了，我们将仔细寻找并应对这种情况。 如果你觉得受到了不公平的待遇，我们非常希望听到你们的声音， 我们将利用这些流程确保你的申诉得到关注和处理。
* 帮助增加良性讨论的实践：想方设法识别出讨论可能已经产生歧义和偏斜的地方。 并提供可实施的信息、方向和资源，以便在这些方面产生积极的影响。
* 重点关注新成员的需求：向他们提供明确的支持和关心， 目的是增加代表人数不足的群体的参与度。
* 每个人都拥有不同的文化背景和语言习惯。 尽可能识别对非英文为母语的参与者造成的任何不必要的误解，并帮助他们了解这一问题以及作出哪些改变以避免造成冒犯。 用一门外语进行复杂的讨论可能非常具有威胁性，我们希望在不同民族和不同文化之间扩大我们的多样性。


## 调解

自愿非正式调解是一种好的调解方式。 在两个或多个当事方都已升级到不适当行为程度的情况下(可悲的是在人类冲突中很常见)， 促进调解进程可能是有益的。 这只是一个例子：委员会在任何情况下都可以考虑调解。 考虑到这一进程完全是自愿的，任何一方都不能被迫参与。 如果委员会建议进行调解，它应当：

* 找到一个可以担任调解员的候选人。
* 取得举报者的同意。 举报者完全可以自由地拒绝调解或提出一名候补调解人。
* 取得被举报人的同意。
* 调解人的问题：各方可以提出不同于推荐候选人的调解人， 只有就所有条件达成共同协议，该进程才能向前推进。
* 最好在两周内确定完成调解的时间计划表。

调解人将与所有参与方接触，寻求各方都满意的解决办法。 在调解完成后，调解方将向委员会提交一份书面报告(经调解过程中所有各方审查通过)，并就今后的实施细则提出建议。 然后委员会将评估调解结果(无论是否达成了令人满意的解决方案)，并对必要的额外的调解动作作出决定。


## 委员会将如何对举报作出回应

当委员会(或委员会成员) 收到举报时， 他们将首先要确定该报告是否涉及明显和严重的违约行为（定义见下文）。 如果确认属实，需要立即采取行动并启动常规的举报调解流程。


## 明确和严重的违约行为

We know that it is painfully common for internet communication to start at or devolve into obvious and flagrant abuse. We will deal quickly with clear and severe breaches like personal threats, violent, sexist or racist language.

When a member of the Code of Conduct Committee becomes aware of a clear and severe breach, they will do the following:

* Immediately disconnect the originator from all NumPy communication channels.
* Reply to the reporter that their report has been received and that the originator has been disconnected.
* In every case, the moderator should make a reasonable effort to contact the originator, and tell them specifically how their language or actions qualify as a “clear and severe breach”. The moderator should also say that, if the originator believes this is unfair or they want to be reconnected to NumPy, they have the right to ask for a review, as below, by the Code of Conduct Committee. The moderator should copy this explanation to the Code of Conduct Committee.
* The Code of Conduct Committee will formally review and sign off on all cases where this mechanism has been applied to make sure it is not being used to control ordinary heated disagreement.


## Report handling

When a report is sent to the Committee they will immediately reply to the reporter to confirm receipt. This reply must be sent within 72 hours, and the group should strive to respond much quicker than that.

If a report doesn’t contain enough information, the Committee will obtain all relevant data before acting. The Committee is empowered to act on the Steering Council’s behalf in contacting any individuals involved to get a more complete account of events.

The Committee will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* Who are the responsible party(ies).
* Whether this is an ongoing situation, and there is a threat to anyone’s physical safety.

This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the group’s deliberations will be recorded and retained (i.e. chat transcripts, email discussions, recorded conference calls, summaries of voice conversations, etc).

It is important to retain an archive of all activities of this Committee to ensure consistency in behavior and provide institutional memory for the project. To assist in this, the default channel of discussion for this Committee will be a private mailing list accessible to current and future members of the Committee as well as members of the Steering Council upon justified request. If the Committee finds the need to use off-list communications (e.g. phone calls for early/rapid response), it should in all cases summarize these back to the list so there’s a good record of the process.

The Code of Conduct Committee should aim to have a resolution agreed upon within two weeks. In the event that a resolution can’t be determined in that time, the Committee will respond to the reporter(s) with an update and projected timeline for resolution.


## Resolutions

The Committee must agree on a resolution by consensus. If the group cannot reach consensus and deadlocks for over a week, the group will turn the matter over to the Steering Council for resolution.

Possible responses may include:

* Taking no further action:
  -   if we determine no violations have occurred;
  -   if the matter has been resolved publicly while the Committee was considering responses.
* Coordinating voluntary mediation: if all involved parties agree, the Committee may facilitate a mediation process as detailed above.
* Remind publicly, and point out that some behavior/actions/language have been judged inappropriate and why in the current context, or can but hurtful to some people, requesting the community to self-adjust.
* A private reprimand from the Committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, the group chair will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email, cc’ing the group.
* A public reprimand. In this case, the Committee chair will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred, within the limits of practicality. E.g., the original mailing list for an email violation, but for a chat room discussion where the person/context may be gone, they can be reached by other means. The group may choose to publish this message elsewhere for documentation purposes.
* A request for a public or private apology, assuming the reporter agrees to this idea: they may at their discretion refuse further contact with the violator. The chair will deliver this request. The Committee may, if it chooses, attach “strings” to this request: for example, the group may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain one’s membership on a mailing list.
* A “mutually agreed upon hiatus” where the Committee asks the individual to temporarily refrain from community participation. If the individual chooses not to take a temporary break voluntarily, the Committee may issue a “mandatory cooling off period”.
* A permanent or temporary ban from some or all NumPy spaces (mailing lists, gitter.im, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future or otherwise maintained.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the Committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The Committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record.

Finally, the Committee will make a report to the NumPy Steering Council (as well as the NumPy core team in the event of an ongoing resolution, such as a ban).

The Committee will never publicly discuss the issue; all public statements will be made by the chair of the Code of Conduct Committee or the NumPy Steering Council.


## Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest, a Committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary.
