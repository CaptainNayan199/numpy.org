Numby是一个社区驱动的开源项目，由一群十分多样化的[贡献者](/gallery/team.html)开发。 Numpy的领导层承诺要打造一个开放，包容，积极向上的社区。 请阅读 [ NumPy 行为准则](/code-of-conduct) 以了解如何用促进社区繁荣的方式与他人交流互动。

我们提供多种交流渠道，可以用来学习知识、分享您的专业见解、或是与 NumPy 社区中的其他人联系。


## Participate online

以下是直接参与 NumPy 项目和社区的方法。 _注意，我们鼓励用户和社区成员在使用问题上相互帮助——参阅 [获取帮助](/gethelp)。_


### [NumPy 邮件列表](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion)

这个列表是较长形式讨论的主要讨论区，例如将新功能添加到Numpy，更改Numpy 路线图或是各种项目级的决策。 Announcements about NumPy, such as for releases, developer meetings, sprints or conference talks are also made on this list.

On this list please use bottom posting, reply to the list (rather than to another sender), and don't reply to digests. 这个列表提供了一个可检索的 [归档](http://numpy-discussion.10968.n7.nabble.com/)。

### [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues)

- For bug reports (e.g. "`np.arange(3).shape` returns `(5,)`, when it should return `(3,)`");
- documentation issues (e.g. "I found this section unclear");
- and feature requests (e.g. "I would like to have a new interpolation method in `np.percentile`").

_Please note that GitHub is not the right place to report a security vulnerability. If you think you have found a security vulnerability in NumPy, please report it [here](https://tidelift.com/docs/security)._

***

### [Slack](https://numpy-team.slack.com)

A real-time chat room to ask questions about _contributing_ to NumPy. This is a private space, specifically meant for people who are hesitant to bring up their questions or ideas on a large public mailing list or GitHub. Please see [here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html#contributing-to-numpy) for more details and how to get an invite.


## Study Groups and Meetups

If you would like to find a local meetup or study group to learn more about NumPy and the wider ecosystem of Python packages for data science and scientific computing, we recommend exploring the [PyData meetups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/pydata/) (150+ meetups, 100,000+ members).

NumPy also organizes in-person sprints for its team and interested contributors occasionally. These are typically planned several months in advance and will be announced on the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/numpy-discussion) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/numpy_team).


## Conferences

The NumPy project doesn't organize its own conferences. The conferences that have traditionally been most popular with NumPy maintainers, contributors and users are the SciPy and PyData conference series:

- [SciPy US](https://conference.scipy.org)
- [EuroSciPy](https://www.euroscipy.org)
- [SciPy Latin America](https://www.scipyla.org)
- [SciPy India](https://scipy.in)
- [SciPy Japan](https://conference.scipy.org)
- [PyData conferences](https://pydata.org/event-schedule/) (15-20 events a year spread over many countries)

Many of these conferences include tutorial days that cover NumPy and/or sprints where you can learn how to contribute to NumPy or related open source projects.


## Join the NumPy community

To thrive, the NumPy project needs your expertise and enthusiasm. Not a coder? Not a problem! There are many ways to contribute to NumPy.

If you are interested in becoming a NumPy contributor (yay!) we recommend checking out our [Contribute](/contribute) page.
