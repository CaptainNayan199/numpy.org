### Advancing an inclusive culture in the scientific Python ecosystem

_August 31, 2021_ -- We are happy to announce the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has [awarded a grant](https://chanzuckerberg.com/newsroom/czi-awards-16-million-for-foundational-open-source-software-tools-essential-to-biomedicine/) to support the onboarding, inclusion, and retention of people from historically marginalized groups on scientific Python projects, and to structurally improve the community dynamics for NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

As a part of [CZI's Essential Open Source Software for Science program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/), this [Diversity & Inclusion supplemental grant](https://cziscience.medium.com/advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-scientific-open-source-eaabe6a5488b) will support the creation of dedicated Contributor Experience Lead positions to identify, document, and implement practices to foster inclusive open-source communities. This project will be led by Melissa Mendonça (NumPy), with additional mentorship and guidance provided by Ralf Gommers (NumPy, SciPy), Hannah Aizenman and Thomas Caswell (Matplotlib), Matt Haberland (SciPy), and Joris Van den Bossche (Pandas).

This is an ambitious project aiming to discover and implement activities that should structurally improve the community dynamics of our projects. By establishing these new cross-project roles, we hope to introduce a new collaboration model to the Scientific Python communities, allowing community-building work within the ecosystem to be done more efficiently and with greater outcomes. We also expect to develop a clearer picture of what works and what doesn't in our projects to engage and retain new contributors, especially from historically underrepresented groups. Finally, we plan on producing detailed reports on the actions executed, explaining how they have impacted our projects in terms of representation and interaction with our communities.

The two-year project is expected to start by November 2021, and we are excited to see the results from this work! [You can read the full proposal here](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Advancing_an_inclusive_culture_in_the_scientific_Python_ecosystem/16548063).

### 2021 NumPy survey

_July 12, 2021_ -- At NumPy, we believe in the power of our community. 1,236 NumPy users from 75 countries participated in our inaugural survey last year. The survey findings gave us a very good understanding of what we should focus on for the next 12 months.

It’s time for another survey, and we are counting on you once again. It will take about 15 minutes of your time. Besides English, the survey questionnaire is available in 8 additional languages: Bangla, French, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

This NumPy release is the result of 581 merged pull requests contributed by 175 people. The Python versions supported for this release are 3.7-3.9, support for Python 3.10 will be added after Python 3.10 is released.


### 2020 NumPy survey results

_Jun 22, 2021_ -- In 2020, the NumPy survey team in partnership with students and faculty from the University of Michigan and the University of Maryland conducted the first official NumPy community survey. Find the survey results here: https://numpy.org/user-survey-2020/.


### Numpy 1.20.0 release

_Jan 30, 2021_ -- [NumPy 1.20.0](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/release/1.20.0-notes.html) is now available. This is the largest NumPy release to date, thanks to 180+ contributors. The two most exciting new features are:
- 为大部分Numpy代码做了类型注解，並添加了一个全新的`numpy.typing` 子模块，其中包含 `ArrayLike` 和 `DtypeLike`别名 ，使得用户和下游依赖库可以为自己的代码添加类型注解。
- 为多个架构进行SIMD编译优化，其支持X86(SSE、AVX)、ARM64(Neon) 和PowerPC(VSX) 指令集。 大幅提高许多函数的性能(例如： [sin/cos](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/17587), [einsum](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/18194))。

### Diversity in the NumPy project

_Sep 20, 2020_ -- We wrote a [statement on the state of, and discussion on social media around, diversity and inclusion in the NumPy project](/diversity_sep2020).


### First official NumPy paper published in Nature!

_Sep 16, 2020_ -- We are pleased to announce the publication of [the first official paper on NumPy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2) as a review article in Nature. This comes 14 years after the release of NumPy 1.0. The paper covers applications and fundamental concepts of array programming, the rich scientific Python ecosystem built on top of NumPy, and the recently added array protocols to facilitate interoperability with external array and tensor libraries like CuPy, Dask, and JAX.


### Python 3.9 is coming, when will NumPy release binary wheels?

_Sept 14, 2020_ -- Python 3.9 will be released in a few weeks. If you are an early adopter of Python versions, you may be dissapointed to find that NumPy (and other binary packages like SciPy) will not have binary wheels ready on the day of the release. It is a major effort to adapt the build infrastructure to a new Python version and it typically takes a few weeks for the packages to appear on PyPI and conda-forge. In preparation for this event, please make sure to
- 将您的 `pip` 升级到 20.1 版本，至少要支持`manylinux2010` 和 `manylinux2014`
- 使用 [`--only-binary=numpy`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#cmdoption-only-binary) 或 `--only-binary=:all:` 选项来防止 `pip` 尝试从源码构建。


### Numpy 1.19.2 release

_Sep 10, 2020_ -- [NumPy 1.19.2](https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.19.2-notes.html) is now available. This latest release in the 1.19 series fixes several bugs, prepares for the [upcoming Cython 3.x release](http://docs.cython.org/en/latest/src/changes.html) and pins setuptools to keep distutils working while upstream modifications are ongoing. The aarch64 wheels are built with the latest manylinux2014 release that fixes the problem of differing page sizes used by different linux distros.

### The inaugural NumPy survey is live!

_Jul 2, 2020_ -- This survey is meant to guide and set priorities for decision-making about the development of NumPy as software and as a community. The survey is available in 8 additional languages besides English: Bangla, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and French.

Please help us make NumPy better and take the survey [here](https://umdsurvey.umd.edu/jfe/form/SV_8bJrXjbhXf7saAl).


### NumPy has a new logo!

_Jun 24, 2020_ -- NumPy now has a new logo:

<img src="/images/logos/numpy_logo.svg" alt="NumPy logo" title="The new NumPy logo" width=300>

The logo is a modern take on the old one, with a cleaner design. Thanks to Isabela Presedo-Floyd for designing the new logo, as well as to Travis Vaught for the old logo that served us well for 15+ years.


### NumPy 1.19.0 release

_Jun 20, 2020_ -- NumPy 1.19.0 is now available. This is the first release without Python 2 support, hence it was a "clean-up release". The minimum supported Python version is now Python 3.6. An important new feature is that the random number generation infrastructure that was introduced in NumPy 1.17.0 is now accessible from Cython.


### Season of Docs acceptance

_May 11, 2020_ -- NumPy has been accepted as one of the mentor organizations for the Google Season of Docs program. We are excited about the opportunity to work with a technical writer to improve NumPy's documentation once again! For more details, please see [the official Season of Docs site](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) and our [ideas page](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/Google-Season-of-Docs-2020-Project-Ideas).


### NumPy 1.18.0 release

_Dec 22, 2019_ -- NumPy 1.18.0 is now available. After the major changes in 1.17.0, this is a consolidation release. It is the last minor release that will support Python 3.5. Highlights of the release includes the addition of basic infrastructure for linking with 64-bit BLAS and LAPACK libraries, and a new C-API for `numpy.random`.

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/releases/tag/v1.18.0) for more details.


### NumPy receives a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative

_Nov 15, 2019_ -- We are pleased to announce that NumPy and OpenBLAS, one of NumPy's key dependencies, have received a joint grant for $195,000 from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative through their [Essential Open Source Software for Science program](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/) that supports software maintenance, growth, development, and community engagement for open source tools critical to science.

This grant will be used to ramp up the efforts in improving NumPy documentation, website redesign, and community development to better serve our large and rapidly growing user base, and ensure the long-term sustainability of the project. While the OpenBLAS team will focus on addressing sets of key technical issues, in particular thread-safety, AVX-512, and thread-local storage (TLS) issues, as well as algorithmic improvements in ReLAPACK (Recursive LAPACK) on which OpenBLAS depends.

More details on our proposed initiatives and deliverables can be found in the [full grant proposal](https://figshare.com/articles/Proposal_NumPy_OpenBLAS_for_Chan_Zuckerberg_Initiative_EOSS_2019_round_1/10302167). The work is scheduled to start on Dec 1st, 2019 and continue for the next 12 months.
